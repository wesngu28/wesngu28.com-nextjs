# My Website

My personal portfolio/website, a Next.js project powered by Vercel over at [wesngu28.com](https://wesngu28.com). This was honestly entertaining to make and I learned more about React and next in particular, as well as finally figuring out how Tailwind works.

My domain registar is Porkbun and the dns points to Vercel's servers.
