# My Website

My personal portfolio/website, a Next.js project powered by Vercel over at [wesngu28.com](https://wesngu28.com). 

This was honestly entertaining to make and I learned more about React and next in particular, as well as finally figuring out how Tailwind works. I begun development drafting a basic html/css/javascript site with a lot of placeholders. I wanted to practice more React and Next so I decided to include a superflous but fun about me section to include more reactive state and API calls. 

The scrollytelling thing is something that I wish could be more optimized but Mapbox on its own is already intensive. I initially found a Mapbox documentation geared towards non-developers but it relied on script tags and style tags inside the html and there was no real documentation for React, so I set out to transcribe it using my knowledge of intersection observer and the react-mapbox-gl library.
